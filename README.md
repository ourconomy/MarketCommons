# MarketCommons

A functional specification for a database for market information on a sustainable economy such as spanned by, for example, [OpenFairDB](https://github.com/flosse/openfairdb/) and its frontend [Karte von morgen](https://kartevonmorgen.org/), without being limited to these

## Participate

If you are interested in this project, please let me know. I write this functional specification because I would like a system like this to exist, but I cannot achieve it on my own. Any contribution is always welcome.
